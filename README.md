# Repository for Data Structures and Algorithms
This is a repository for popular data structures that I learned when I took my Data Structures course at my university.
The plan for this repository is to complete the most important data structures such as:

1. **Deques** (A data structure that can do both the operations of a Stack and a Queue).
2. **Dictionaries** (Implementation using AVLTree, BinarySearchTree and Chained Array).
3. **Heaps (Priority Queues)**
4. **Sorting Algorithms** (In progress)
5. **Graph Algorithms** (In progress)

## Purpose
I built this project primarily to test my skills with various Data Structures and to practice with them. I've included
tests in my project that were designed to test the behavior of the data structures built so far. After passing all of
these tests, I'm confident that these structures have been well implemented. In any case, feel free to give feedback as
to where it might be helpful to test for a possible **hard to detect edge case**.

## How to Use
1. Fork the repository into your own local machine.
2.
