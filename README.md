# Repository for Data Structures and Algorithms
This is a repository for popular data structures that I learned when I took my Data Structures course at the University
of Washington. What I'm including here is all the programs we were required to build for our projects. The plan for this
repository is to showcase all the different Data Structures that I built such as:

1. **Deques** (A data structure that can do both the operations of a Stack and a Queue).
2. **Dictionaries** (Implementation using AVLTree, BinarySearchTree and Hash Table).
3. **Heaps (Priority Queues)**
4. **Sorting Algorithms** 
5. **Graph Algorithms**
